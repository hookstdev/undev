# Huygen's Wave Theory

## Terminology

### Wavefront:

It is a continuous locus of all points in a medium which oscillate with the same phase.<br>
Direction of propogation of wave is perpendicular to wavefront.<br>
|Wavefront|Shape of light source|Variation of Amplitude (A)|Variation of Intensity (I)|
|-|-|-|-|
|Spherical|Point source|$A∝\dfrac{1}{d}$|$I∝\dfrac{1}{d^2}$|
|Cylindrical|Linear source|$A∝\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$|$I∝\dfrac{1}{d}$|
|Planar|Extended large source|$A=constant$|$I=constant$|

## Huygen's Principle

* Every point on the wavefront becomes a new source of "secondary wavelets".
* The common tangent plane to these secondary wavelets shows the new postion of wavefront.
* If we know the shape at a given time, we can determine the shape for any other later time.

## Applications

1. Proof of Law of Reflection: $\angle i=\angle r$
2. Proof of Law of Refraction: $\mu_{1}sin(i)=\mu_{2}sin(r)$

$Δx=(μ-1)t$

$ΔS=(dsin(\theta)-Δx)$
