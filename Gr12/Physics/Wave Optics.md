# Huygen's Wave Theory

## Terminology

### Wavefront:

It is a continuous locus of all points in a medium which oscillate with the same phase.<br>
Direction of propogation of wave is perpendicular to wavefront.<br>
| Wavefront   | Shape of light source | Variation of Amplitude (A) | Variation of Intensity (I) |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Spherical   | Point source          | $A∝\dfrac{1}{d}$           | $I∝\dfrac{1}{d^2}$         |
| Cylindrical | Linear source         | $A∝\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$    | $I∝\dfrac{1}{d}$           |
| Planar      | Extended large source | $A=constant$               | $I=constant$               |

## Huygen's Principle

* Every point on the wavefront becomes a new source of "secondary wavelets".
* The common tangent plane to these secondary wavelets shows the new postion of wavefront.
* If we know the shape at a given time, we can determine the shape for any other later time.
* It could prove rectilinear propogation, Reflection, Refraction, Diffraction, Interference.
* It could not explain photoelectric effect.

## Applications

1. Proof of Law of Reflection: $\angle i=\angle r$
2. Proof of Law of Refraction: $\mu_{1}sin(i)=\mu_{2}sin(r)$

# Interference

## Types of Sources:

1. Coherent: Emits light waves of same wavelength and same phase or constant phase difference.
2. Incoherent: Phase difference is not constant

## Terminology

1. Phase ($\omega t-kx$): The argument of sine or cosine in the expressionn for displacement of a wave.
2. Phase Difference ($\phi$): The Difference in phases of two waves at a point.
3. Path Difference ($\Delta x$): The Difference in path lengths of two waves meeting at a point.

## Types:

1. Constructive: (CI) $\\cos(\phi)=1\\A_{net}=A_{1}+A_{2}$
2. Destructive: (DI) $\\cos(\phi)=-1\\A_{net}=A_{1}-A_{2}$

# Young's Double Slit Experiment (YDSE)

CI at even  multiples of $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$
&nbsp;&nbsp; DI at odd  multiples of $\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$

D: Distance between sources and screen.<br>
d: Distance between the sources.<br>
$y_{n}$<br>
$\beta$ (Fringe width): Distance between any two consecutive bright fringes or any two consecutive dark fringes.<br>
$\Delta \theta$ (Angular Fringe Width): Angular separation between two consecutive bright or dark fringes.<br>

## Variations

### Immersed in a liquid:

In a medium with refractive index $\mu$

$Wavelength=\dfrac{\lambda_{air}}{\mu}$

$\text{Fringe width}=\dfrac{\beta}{\mu}$

$\text{Angular Fringe width}=\dfrac{\beta}{\mu}$

$\text{}=\dfrac{\beta}{\mu}$

# Diffraction

Bending of light tho

$y_{n}=\begin{cases}
        \text{Dark} &\quad \pm\dfrac{n\lambda D}{a}\\\\
        \text{Bright} &\quad \pm\left(\dfrac{2n+1}{2}\right)\dfrac{\lambda D}{a}
    \end{cases}$


| Interference | Diffraction     |
|--------------|-----------------|
| $\Delta x$   | $a sin(\theta)$ |
# Formulae:

$I=\dfrac{P}{A}$

$\phi=\dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}\Delta x$

$A_{net}=\sqrt {A^2_{1}+A^2_{2}+A_{1}A_{2}cos(\phi)}$

$tan(\alpha)=\dfrac{A_{1}sin(\phi)}{A_{2}+A_{1}cos(\phi)}$

$\Delta x=\begin{cases}
       \text{Dark (DI)} &\quad \pm (2n-1)\lambda\\
       \text{Bright (CI)} &\quad \pm n\lambda\\
    \end{cases}$

$y_{n}=\dfrac{\Delta xD}{d}$

$\beta=\dfrac{\lambda D}{d}$

$\Delta \theta=\dfrac{\beta}{D}=\dfrac{\lambda}{d}$

$Δx=(μ-1)t$

$ΔS=(dsin(\theta)-Δx)$

$\beta_{c}=\dfrac{2\lambda D}{a}$
