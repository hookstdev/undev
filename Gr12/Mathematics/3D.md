# Direction Cosines (DC)

$l = cos ( \alpha )$ 

$m = cos ( \beta )$ 

$n = cos ( \gamma )$ 

$$ l^2+m^2+n^2=1 $$

# Direction Ratios  (DR)

# Straight Lines

## 1. Forms of equation:

### a) Cartesian Form
$$ {x-x_{1}\over a} = {y-y_{1}\over b} = {z-z_{1}\over c} = \lambda $$
where, 

$(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ is the given point.<br>
(a,b,c) is the DR of the line.

### b) 


# Plane

### b) Intercept Form:

When the x,y,z intercepts of a plane is a,b,c respectively then: 

$\\\dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{b}+\dfrac{z}{c}=1$
